- 👋 Hi, I’m @averillc
- 👀 I have experience with Python, R, and SQL, I love the world of data, and have some experiencing building Databases in Docker.
- 🌱 I’m currently wading through web development since my only experience was self-taught HTML and I'm curious about front-end customization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can push me further.
